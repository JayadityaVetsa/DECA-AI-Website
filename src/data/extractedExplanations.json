Environmental laws are intended to conserve and protect the natural environment. \nMany of these laws have an impact on the way businesses operate by requiring them to decrease pollution or \ncontrol waste. As a result, businesses often need to spend money to comply with the rules and regulations, \nwhich leads to an increase in operating costs. For example, a business might need to purchase pollution-control \ndevices. Environmental laws do not require businesses to hire more employees or develop exterior landscapes. \nThe laws do not limit equipment purchases.
