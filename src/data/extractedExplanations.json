A positive free cash flow is usually a sign \nthat the company is practicing responsible money management, which can result in increased \nshareholder yield. A negative free cash flow, however, indicates that the company needs to look for more \nand/or other sources of funding. To calculate the free cash flow, we first need to determine the \ncompany's capital expenditures by adding together the net cash used by investing and the net cash used \nby financing ($690,000 + $140,300 = $830,300). Finally, subtract the total capital expenditures from the \ncash flow from operations ($1,375,400 - $830,300 = $545,100).

Organizational change management is planned organization-wide \nchanges or alterations to a major component of the company to increase individual and organizational \neffectiveness. An effective organizational change can increase morale among workers and improve \nemployees' motivation while also driving positive teamwork and job enrichment. Change at the \norganizational level affects all employees, not some. Organizational change is typically felt at a deeper \nlevel and for a longer period of time, not a short period of time. By improving morale among workers, \neffective organizational change improves the quality of work while shortening production cycles and, \nthus, reducing costs. \nSOURCE:   SM:094 \nSOURCE:   Michigan State University.

      "explanation": "A \nPrepare the organization for change. If a manager is focused on helping their staff recognize the need for \nchange and raising awareness of various challenges facing the organization, they are displaying the first \nstep of the change management process—prepare the organization for change. During this stage the \norganization has to prepare the organization for change both logistically and culturally and must gain buy-\nin from employees who will help implement the change. Crafting a vision and planning for change is the \nsecond step, which entails developing a plan for change that includes the goals and scope of the project. \nImplementing the process is the third step, followed by embedding the changes within the company \nculture. The latter step focuses on making the implemented changes from step three the status quo, \nwhich makes it more difficult to fall back into the old way of doing things. The final step, review progress \nand analyze results, centers around whether the project was a success, a failure, or a mixed result. \nSOURCE:   SM:095 \nSOURCE:   Miller, K.

Budgets are \nplanning tools that help entrepreneurs monitor and manage their ventures' money. Operating budgets estimate \nthe business's day-to-day financial inflows (e.g., sales) and outflows (e.g., payroll and inventory). By setting a \nbudget and comparing it to actual performance, an entrepreneur can evaluate the financial well-being of the \nventure at regular intervals. Entrepreneurs often consider other sources of information when setting the \noperating budget, such as requests for proposal, environmental scans, and inbound-call reports. A request for \nproposal (RFP) is a bid extended to vendors to provide prices for goods and services the business needs. An \nenvironmental scan is an analysis of the environment surrounding the business. An inbound-call report is a \nsummary of phone calls processed by sales and service representatives within a specific time period. \n \nSOURCE: EN:008 Explain tools used by entrepreneurs for venture planning \n \nSOURCE: Bamboo HR.

Four methods used to limit and regulate the activities of federal agencies are statutory \ncontrol, political control, judicial review, and informational control. In many countries, the legislative \nbranch has the power to pass statutes (laws) establishing federal agencies. This enabling legislation \noften identifies limits to the agencies' powers. In other words, these statutes control the agencies' \nactivities. The government wields political control over these agencies by providing (or withholding) \nfunding, by approving (or speaking out against) individuals nominated to lead these agencies, and by \namending the agencies' enabling legislation. The courts can also control federal agencies by reviewing \nand deciding the legality of the agencies' actions. Finally, the public can indirectly control federal \nagencies through information. Most federal agencies are required to provide the public with information \non different topics. After reviewing the information, private citizens can take action to influence the \nactivities of these federal agencies. \nSOURCE:   BL:074 Discuss the role of administrative law \nSOURCE:   Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute.

Guests have the right to expect that the food that they purchase is safe and free from \nbacteria. Since each individual has different standards, it is not realistic to expect hospitality businesses \nto meet everyone's standards. For example, a hotel restaurant cannot create every menu entree to make \neach guest happy. The restaurant must consider several factors including the target market and costs \nassociated with the food.

One way to do so is to alert them via text \nmessage that their table is ready. That way, customers do not have to sit and wait—they can explore the \nsurrounding area, run errands, etc. Providing discounts to guests who wait over 30 minutes is a good \ncustomer service policy, but it will not necessarily help keep customers from becoming impatient while \nthey wait, because they will not receive the discount until they have already eaten. Determining which \naspect of the restaurant's operations is slow can help improve wait times in the long run, but it will not \nkeep customers from becoming impatient while they wait. Finally, checking reviews to see how \ncustomers feel about the wait time is a good way to improve customer service, but it will not help keep \ncustomers from becoming impatient while they wait. \nSOURCE:   CR:038 Identify strategies to manage customer experience during peaks in demand \nSOURCE:   Decker, F.

With this in mind, many people are \nlooking for products that make life easier. For example, a grocery store might offer fully cooked entrees \nand side dishes. These items require little, if any, preparation for eating. Technological and medical \nadvancements have resulted in people living longer. In addition, a large segment of the population, the \nBaby Boomers, is reaching retirement age and might require more health care and related services. \nTherefore, health care needs are not reduced. As a result of technological and other advancements, the \nworld is more fast-paced than in previous generations. Consumers generally want faster response times, \nnot slower response times. An agricultural-based society depends on farming as a way to meet economic \nneeds. The world has shifted to a technological-based society, not an agricultural-based society. \nSOURCE:   PD:066 Explain career opportunities in entrepreneurship \nSOURCE:   LAP-PD-066—Own Your Own (Career Opportunities in Entrepreneurship)",

Personal selling is the form of promotion that determines client needs and wants and \nresponds through planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and \nenhances future business opportunities. Personal selling is often effective when dealing with corporate \ntravel departments and meeting planners because it frequently involves meeting personally with those \npeople to discuss their travel needs. Corporate travel departments and meeting planners arrange travel \nfor many people and are interested in obtaining the best service and price. Having personal \nconversations makes it possible to find out what they need and then offer the services that satisfy those \nneeds. For example, an airline might use personal selling to promote itself as the most efficient and \neconomical carrier for a business whose employees frequently fly across the country. Public relations is a \nfunction of business designed to establish good relations between the business and the public. Radio \nadvertising is a promotional method that reaches a general audience rather than corporate travel \ndepartments and meeting planners.

When a channel leader \nplaces unreasonable pressure on a channel member to do something that is not in the best interest of the \nchannel member, it is using coercion. For example, a channel leader that yields a lot of power in the distribution \nchain may set unrealistic sales goals for a dealer, or it may pressure a supplier to lower its prices to a point that \nit hurts the supplier's profits. Coercion tends to create channel conflict, leads to unfair and unsatisfactory \nbusiness relationships, and often disrupts the distribution process.

A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to avoid conflict within the \nchannel because the leader has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and demand cooperation, which \nreduces the possibility of conflict. The leader's authority makes it possible for the leader to assign specific \nresponsibilities to each channel member and persuade members to accomplish their individual tasks. When \neach member is cooperating and working for the good of the channel, there is less chance of conflict. It is not \nnecessary for the leader to develop friendships.

Customer touch points, which are all the opportunities that businesses \nhave to connect with customers and reinforce their brand values, occur before, during, and after sales \ntransactions. Everyone in the company is responsible for corporate branding--not just the customer service \nrepresentatives. Employees must understand and embrace the brand's values, personality, and promise for the \ncorporate brand to take hold and be a success. Brand cues are elements that remind customers and employees \nof brands and their values. They appear throughout the workplace and community as well as in advertising. \n \nSOURCE: PM:207 Describe factors used by businesses to position corporate brands \n \nSOURCE: Couchman, H. (2023).

Channel stuffing is a deceptive business practice that involves forcing more products through \na distribution channel than can realistically be sold to final consumers. It is used to inflate a company’s sales \nand financial earnings. Because the company shipped an excessive amount of inventory to wholesalers and \nretailers and then booked those products as sales, this is an example of channel stuffing. Price discrimination is \nan illegal activity in which a business charges different customers different prices for the same product. \nCoercion is the practice of using force or threats to persuade someone to do something they would otherwise \nbe unwilling to do.

      "explanation": "C \nGap. The purpose of gap insurance is to cover the difference between the amount of money an \ninsurance provider will pay for a totaled car and the remaining amount owed on the vehicle. Because the \nvalue of a vehicle depreciates quickly, the insurance provider may pay the depreciated value rather than \nthe purchase price of the vehicle. As in Joseph's situation, this can be very costly if a large amount of \nmoney is still owed on an unusable vehicle. Comprehensive insurance pays for vehicle repairs that result \nfrom situations such as fire, hail, vandalism, and theft. Uninsured motorist insurance pays for costs \nassociated with driver and passenger injuries and/or vehicle damages that are caused by uninsured, \nunderinsured, or hit-and-run drivers.

Some homeowners live in areas that are prone to earthquakes or floods. \nBecause basic homeowner insurance policies do not cover these types of incidents, insurance agents \nmight encourage clients living in high-risk areas to purchase optional perils endorsements. Optional perils \nendorsements (riders) are provisions that clients can add to their basic homeowner insurance policies to \nincrease their protection from losses associated with certain risks, such as earthquakes and floods. \nRental unit coverage is a provision that covers a dwelling that an owner rents to others for certain time \nframes, such as a condominium that is located in a resort or recreational area and is rented by \nvacationers.
