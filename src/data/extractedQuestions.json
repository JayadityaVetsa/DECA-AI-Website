Disobeying a manager's orders, obstructionist behavior, displaying unprofessionalism, and \ncausing arguments are some examples of insubordination. There are laws and regulations that prevent \nan employee from being fired because of whistleblowing, retaliation, or alien status. If a business is \nresponsible for violating any rules or regulations, it cannot fire an employee who reports those instances \n(i.e., for whistleblowing). With retaliation, it is illegal to fire someone for asserting their rights under antidiscrimination laws.

Intensive distribution \nmeans selling a product through every available wholesaler and retailer in a geographic area where \nconsumers might look for it.

A business proposal is a formal document created by \na company that is shared with a prospect with the goal of locking in a business agreement. The three \ntypes of business proposals are formally solicited, informally solicited, and unsolicited. Formally solicited \nbusiness proposals are made when a business responds to an official request to write a business \nproposal. With formally solicited business proposals, all of the requirements are known, and you know \nmost or all of the information about the potential buyer—you simply need to write a business proposal for \nthe buyer to review to begin the sales process. An informally solicited business proposal is written when \nthere isn't an official request for a proposal. Rather, it is the result of informal conversations. Unsolicited \nbusiness proposals take a generic, one-size-fits-all approach to business proposals and are similar to \nmarketing brochures or cold emails.

Other benefits of conducting a \nfeasibility study are that it can identify the risks and benefits of a proposed venture (but not necessarily \ndecrease them) and prevent the waste of time and resources on unfeasible ideas.

Rather than making the purchasing process less \nefficient, purchasing systems make it more efficient. Purchasing systems can cut a company's \nadministrative costs, not increase them. They also shorten the length of the purchase cycle, not increase \nit. \nSOURCE: EN:025 \nSOURCE: Hayes, A. (2019, September 2). Purchasing system.

One way a business can organize and improve its workflow is by encouraging its \nemployees to separate duties. If a manager makes sure each individual has their own assigned tasks, it \neliminates confusion as to who is working on what and prevents multiple employees from working on the \nsame task. Prioritizing multitasking, avoiding breaks, and taking work home are not ways to organize and \nimprove workflow. Employees should avoid multitasking, as working on several tasks at once can force \nthe brain to go into overload from the constant back and forth between projects, which slows down \nprogress and productivity. Taking breaks is important, as it refreshes the mind and will allow employees \nto have more focus when returning to their tasks. Employees should avoid taking their work home. If an \nemployee knows they will have more time to work on something later, they may not be as productive \nduring the workday. In addition, working from home after working in the office could cause restlessness \nand can increase exhaustion. \nSOURCE: EN:027 \nSOURCE: Post, J.

A \nBusiness continuity plan. To protect the company's systems and operations from risks or threats like \nnatural disasters or cyberattacks, IT Solutions, Inc. developed a business continuity plan. Business \ncontinuity planning involves identifying any risks to the business, implementing procedures to mitigate \nrisks, testing safeguards, and reviewing the process.

D \nA smooth transition for management and stakeholders. A business exit strategy is an entrepreneur's plan \nto sell their company or share of a company to investors or another company. If the business is \nsuccessful, an exit strategy allows the owner to cut their stake or completely leave a business while \nmaking a profit. An effective exit strategy from a successful business will create a smooth transition for \nmanagement and stakeholders. Other benefits of an effective exit strategy are that it protects the value of \nthe business, enhances the future worth and stature of the business, and reduces or defers the potential \ntax impact on the owner's estate, spouse, or family. \nSOURCE: EN:037 \nSOURCE: Kauffman FastTrac.

Direct writers are insurance agents who are employed by a \nspecific company to issue its insurance policies. Direct writers are tied to one insurance provider, which \nrestricts them to selling certain products and prevents them from shopping around for the best price. \nIndependent agents are insurance agents who are not employed by a specific company; rather, they sell \ninsurance policies from multiple companies and are paid on commission for each policy sold. Because \nindependent agents are not employed by a specific agency, they pay their own expenses.

A \nLegal procedure. Procedural law controls the workings of courts and the method by which rights are \nenforced. Legal procedure means that rights must be enforced in court, so the business is guaranteed an \nopportunity to present evidence to defend itself. This is not because of legislative history, personal rights, \nor business rules. \nSOURCE: BL:070 Describe the nature of legal procedure \nSOURCE: Weigend, T., Yeazell, S.",

Ourway Airlines is acquiring many smaller companies, which is known as consolidation. A \nmerger occurs when two businesses combine to form one company. An expansion occurs when a \ncompany sells more shares of stock, reinvests profits into itself, or obtains a bank loan to expand its \noperations. A hybrid structure is a type of ownership that allows owners to enjoy the advantages of \ncorporations and either sole proprietorships or partnerships. \nSOURCE: BL:003 Explain types of business ownership \nSOURCE: LAP-BL-003—Own It Your Way (Types of Business Ownership) \n \n 3. C \nThe property will be required to pay damages to the individual for breaking a legal contract. A room \nreservation is a legal contract that entitles an injured party to compensation when the contract is violated, \nsuch as when a property does not follow through with its promise to provide a room. A room reservation \ndoes not have to be in writing for it to be considered a contract; therefore, the individual is entitled to \nreceive damages. For a property to be considered fraudulent in the eyes of the court, it is necessary to \nprove that the property overbooks as a rule, rather than as an exception, when a special event is in town. \nThe ability to find a room elsewhere is not grounds for dismissing a case in which an individual is \nphysically harmed as a result of being turned away by the hotel. \nSOURCE: BL:065 Explain the nature of regulations affecting the hospitality and tourism industry \nSOURCE: Webster,",

A \n \nTo empower staff members to resolve customer service complaints. When hotels train their staff members on \nusing guest recovery solutions, it gives them the confidence and the tools to resolve customer complaints \neffectively. The purpose of guest recovery is to resolve any dissatisfaction so that guests come back for another \nvisit. Guest recovery solutions are actions taken to satisfy guests' needs and requests to increase customer \nloyalty. When customers are unhappy, explaining hotel policies is not likely to appease them. The use of guest \nrecovery solutions is not typically related to a hotel's legal obligations and does not reduce them. A hotel's legal \nobligations relate to protecting a guest's privacy and safety and to fulfilling the contractual obligations of a \nguest's reservations. \n \nSOURCE: CR:045 Explain the nature of guest recovery \n \nSOURCE: \nSchim, J.

It's crucial for a waiter to respectfully listen to an \nunsatisfied diner to show concern and to determine the true cause of dissatisfaction. Explaining that a steak \nwas properly prepared when the customer feels differently shows a lack of respect and concern. Instead of \noffering one solution, the staff member should work with the customer to determine what solution they would \nprefer. For example, if the diner doesn't have time to wait for a new meal, offering one is a poor solution. It is \nalso important for a staff member to follow up with the customer to make sure they are satisfied with their \nexperience before leaving the restaurant. If a staff member fails to handle and resolve customer complaints in a \nsatisfactory manner, the customer is likely to never return. \n \nSOURCE: CR:046 Determine strategies for resolving customer-service situations \n \nSOURCE: \nHouston Chronicle.

Distribution channels are paths or routes that \ngoods or services take from the producer to the ultimate consumer or industrial user. While customers taking \npart in a loyalty program may be asked to identify their preferred communication channels, they aren't typically \nasked about their preferred distribution channels. \n \nSOURCE: NF:283 Describe methods used to collect hospitality and tourism business information (e.g., \nobservations, mail, telephone, Internet, discussion groups, interviews) \n \nSOURCE: \nOpenKey.

Solo travel is a growing trend that hospitality and tourism companies should take note of. Many \npeople—both young and old—enjoy traveling alone for various reasons. While traveling solo in the past may \nhave been considered unsafe (or even socially unacceptable), solo trips today are increasingly popular. This is \nan example of a guest trend that impacts the hospitality and tourism industry, not a technological change, \neconomic trend, or regulatory shift. \n \nSOURCE: NF:287 Track environmental changes that impact hospitality and tourism (e.g., technological \nchanges, guest trends, economic changes, regulatory changes) \n \nSOURCE: \nRevfine.com.

Leo's report is important for the general manager because it will provide \nthem with the information they need to make a decision on how to deal with the budgetary issues. The report \nshould first include an introduction, where Leo can state the purpose of the report and describe the budgetary \nissues. Next, Leo should work on the body of the report, which will include facts, statistics, and other relevant \ninformation. This is followed by a conclusion, which provides a short summary of the report and reinforces the \nmessage. After writing the report, Leo should proofread and edit it. A short report typically does not include \nformal plans to correct issues. That step will likely occur after Leo submits his report to the general manager. \n \nSOURCE: NF:292 Prepare written reports for hospitality and tourism decision-making \n \nSOURCE: \nThompson, J.

Customers now expect to be able to find and book hotel rooms, \nview accommodation photos, check in to their destinations, compare prices, and more—all from their devices. \nOne way that hospitality companies have responded to this growing trend is by offering more robust \nsmartphone apps. Many hotels now offer apps that provide most of the same benefits of the traditional website, \nincluding tours of hotel rooms, price comparison tools, reviews, and check-in/check-out services.

One of the main roles of a project manager is to lead the group to \nachieve the project's goal.

Employee pilferage involves the taking of small amounts or small articles without \nthe consent of the company. That is what occurs when an employee pads their expense account. Having \nauthorization to change the amount specified on a check is not pilferage.

It would be very \nexpensive to change traditional locks every week.

Possession utility is created when ownership of a product is transferred from the seller to the user. \nPossession utility can be created through promotions which increase consumer demand for goods. Businesses \nalso help create possession utility by offering a number of purchasing arrangements that make it easy for \ncustomers to buy. Financial is not a type of utility. Time utility is having the products available at the time they \nare desired. Creating place utility means having the products, both goods and services, available at the place \nwhere they are needed by the consumer. \n \nSOURCE: EC:004 Determine economic utilities created by business activities \n \nSOURCE: LAP-EC-013—Use It (Economic Utility) \n \n16. C \n \nThe government pays workers based on quantity rather than quality. In a communist command economy, most \nresources are allocated toward industrial goods rather than consumer goods. The few consumer goods that are \navailable are often poor quality because the government pays workers based on the quantity, not the quality, of \nwhat they produce. People in communist command economies need consumer goods as much as those in \nother economic systems do. High taxes do not necessarily have a direct effect on production of consumer \ngoods. Finally, people in a communist command economy do not consume everything that they produce; this is \ninstead a characteristic of a traditional economy. \n \nSOURCE: EC:007 Explain the types of economic systems \n \nSOURCE: LAP-EC-907—Who's the Boss? (Economic Systems) \n \n17. C \n \nUse a price deflator. Inflation can distort GDP by making it higher, not because production has increased, but \nbecause prices are higher. A price deflator is an economic metric that converts prices to a base dollar value and \nallows GDP to be accurately compared over time. Double counting occurs when production is counted more \nthan once. It is not related to inflation. The balance of trade is the difference between imports and exports. It \ndoes not relate to the effects of inflation on GDP. Nominal GDP is GDP that has not been adjusted to account \nfor the effects of inflation.

(Gross Domestic Product) \n \n18. D \n \nRecession. A recession is a six-month's contraction in the gross domestic product (GDP). A recession usually \nresults in rising unemployment and people having less money to spend on consumer goods. Excess demand \nexists when consumers want more goods than are available to buy. Inflation is a rise in prices that may occur \nwhen demand exceeds supply. A trade deficit results from more imports than exports. \n \nSOURCE: EC:018 Determine the impact of business cycles on business activities \n \nSOURCE: LAP-EC-918—Boom or Bust (Impact of Business Cycles) \n \n\nTest 1264 MARKETING CLUSTER EXAM—KEY 5 \n \nCopyright © 2023 by MBA Research and Curriculum Center\n®\n, Columbus, Ohio \n19. B \n \nLaw of diminishing returns. The law of diminishing returns is an economic concept that states that if one input \nincreases while others are constant, at some point the increases in output will decline. In this example, Kelly \nadded six new employees to her business without changing anything else. Kelly's business reached the point at \nwhich output could no longer increase unless the inputs also increased. This example demonstrates the law of \ndiminishing returns, not the need for effective employee training, the harm of taking business risks, or the \ndanger of hiring employees. \n \nSOURCE: EC:023 Explain the impact of the law of diminishing returns \n \nSOURCE: LAP-EC-023—Know Your Limits (Law of Diminishing Returns) \n \n20. D \n \nTight money supply. Many factors affect interest rates, including business cycles, consumer spending, inflation, \nand the money supply. If the money supply is low or tight, there is less money available to lend. This causes \ninterest rates to increase. The government might implement policies to tighten the money supply when the rate \nof inflation rapidly increases. When investment spending increases, the money supply is usually loose, so \ninterest rates are lower—it is cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow money. During a recession, \nbusinesses are not expanding, unemployment increases, and consumer spending decreases. Because a \nrecession negatively affects the economy, the government may implement policies that lower interest rates to \nstimulate commercial growth and consumer spending. \n \nSOURCE: EC:084 Explain the economic impact of interest-rate fluctuations \n \nSOURCE: Heakal, R.

B \n \nShows you what areas to improve. Feedback can be very valuable because it shows you how you are doing. If \nyou know what you are doing wrong, you can change that behavior in the future. Feedback does not \nnecessarily reinforce your own opinions, as others may have a different view of you than you have of yourself. \nFeedback should address your strengths and weaknesses, not those of others. You should not allow negative \nfeedback to make you defensive.

Your level of self-esteem can fluctuate from high to low. Feeling that you could do a \njob you have read about would indicate your level of self-esteem is high.

Those who use the combative style of negotiating are ready to fight for what they want at any cost. \nIt often involves a \"no-compromise\" attitude. This style is useful in short-term situations, particularly if you won't \nsee the other person again. However, it usually does not build long-term relationships. The collaborative style \ninvolves people working together to create an outcome that benefits both parties.

In the situation provided, Madeline indicates that she doesn't have \ncomplete information but is confident that her staff will be able to handle unexpected problems after the system \nhas been implemented. Madeline has a high level of tolerance for ambiguity because she is taking action \nwithout knowing what circumstances she may encounter along the way. Personal vision is the future you wish \nto create. Self-control is the ability to restrain your feelings, words, and actions. Madeline may have self-control \nand vision; however, there is not enough information provided to indicate that she is using self-control to \nmanage difficult emotions or that she is implementing the new system to achieve her vision.

Salespeople tend to judge these situations differently—according to their personal code of \nethics. One of the questionable situations that salespeople might encounter involves entertaining customers. \nWhile some businesses view entertainment as a way to build positive customer relationships, others view it as \nfavoritism or bribery. By developing entertainment guidelines for their salespeople, businesses can clearly \ncommunicate acceptable and unacceptable entertainment activities.

Many businesses produce products that might be harmful to consumers if \nthe products are tampered with or become contaminated. To protect consumers, businesses often use tamperresistant packaging which makes it extremely difficult for someone to get to the product without damaging the \npackaging. As a result, customers are able to easily determine if this type of packaging has been tampered \nwith, which warns them not to buy the products. Using tamper-resistant packaging is an ethical procedure that \nbusinesses follow in an effort to protect their products and ensure the safety of their customers. Products \nusually are not wrapped in plain paper. Placing informative commercials on TV and explaining the new \nmanufacturing process are not ways of protecting consumers. \n \nSOURCE: PM:040 Explain business ethics in product/service management \n \nSOURCE: Container and Packaging.

Because product quality and price can easily be matched, customer service becomes a key \ncomponent in business competition. In selling, customer service is where the real competition among \nbusinesses begins.

Usually, the bundled products are offered for one, allinclusive price. An example is a business selling a computer, a printer, and ink cartridges as a unit. In many \ncases, the bundle is less expensive than the cost of each item sold separately. Sometimes, the products can \nonly be purchased as a unit and are not available separately.

If an analysis indicates that customers are buying more of one type of product and that the trend will \ncontinue, a business can take advantage of the change by providing that type of product. However, to be \nprepared to take advantage of such opportunities, a business first must analyze the environment to determine \nexactly what those opportunities are. A situational analysis also indicates possible threats to the business. \nExamples of threats include suppliers raising their prices and a decline in economic conditions. Increases in \noperating expenses is an internal problem. \n \nSOURCE: MP:008 Explain the role of situation analysis in the marketing planning process \n \nSOURCE: Lorette, K. (2019, February 12).

D \n \nConducting exploratory research. Exploratory research is marketing research that collects information to help \nthe business define its issue, situation, or concern and decide which direction to go in order to address it. \nSurveys that consist of open-ended questions require respondents to provide more than a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. \nAn open-ended question is a type of unstructured question that allows a respondent the opportunity to express \nopinions, state issues, and provide ideas. By obtaining this type of in-depth, qualitative information, the \nresearcher may be able to define the problem and determine in which direction to proceed with the research. \nLong and technical surveys tend to overwhelm the respondents, so open-ended questions may not be \nanswered fully, if at all. The use of open-ended questions yields subjective responses that are based on \nopinions and personal feelings. \n \nSOURCE: IM:293 Evaluate questionnaire design (e.g., types of questions, question wording, routing, \nsequencing, length, layout) \n \nSOURCE: Qualtrics.

Horizontal conflict occurs between channel members at the same level, such as when two \nmiddlemen on the same level compete to sell the same manufacturer's product to the same target market. \nVertical conflict occurs between channel members at different levels within the same channel. Usually, vertical \nconflict occurs between producers and wholesalers or producers and retailers. Conflict of interest is a situation \nin which it is impossible to be truly impartial.

It is important for Marcel to track his expenses \nbecause he needs to make sure that he has enough income to pay for his bills (e.g., rent, utilities, car). To track \nhis spending, Marcel should record his expenses in a central location so he can see bill amounts and bill due \ndates. Recording and keeping receipts is also important for tax reporting purposes and for tax auditing \nsituations.

C \n \nA weakness of the private enterprise system. Although private enterprise systems are economically productive, \nthey do have some negative aspects. One of these is that property and income are not equally distributed. The \nprivate enterprise system does not always make it easy for people to increase their income, especially if they do \nnot have access to higher education, training, and skills. Charlie's family does not have the money to pay for \nhim to go to college, so it was difficult for him to improve his financial standing. Val, on the other hand, was born \ninto a family with wealth, so it was easier for her to increase her income through education.

C \n \nOngoing communication. Employees' goals should align with the business's organizational goals. To ensure \nthat employees understand the importance of their work and their roles in achieving the business's goals, \nmanagers must communicate with the employees on an ongoing basis.

The principle of due care means performing the role of accountant as \nwell as possible.

C \n \nThe company wants to increase its market share. Most businesses have goals for their firms, and the products \nthey sell should help the firms achieve those objectives. When a product no longer helps a business attain its \nshare of a particular market, the firm may decide to replace it with a product that may do so. The firm in this \ncase is not expanding its product line, since it is simply replacing one product with another. A product that sells \nwell or is a collectible would be a good reason for the company to keep the product in its product mix. \n \nSOURCE: PM:003 Explain the concept of product mix \n \nSOURCE: LAP-PM-003—Mix and Match (The Nature of the Product Mix) \n \n77.

Complex products that require assembly or that have multiple functions should \nprovide detailed written instructions to help the customer assemble or use the product correctly. When the \nproduct is assembled or used correctly, there is less risk of injury to the product user and less risk associated \nwith product damage.

One activity that may reduce competition is a manufacturer \nclosing a sales territory to keep its competitors from obtaining access to the market.

When customers change phone numbers and email addresses, \nmove, or go out of business, a company needs to update its customer database to reflect the changes. A \ncompany with outdated customer information is more likely to experience financial losses. For example, a \ncompany may not be able to collect payment on overdue accounts if it cannot reach its customers by phone to \nfollow up. Also, a company's promotional mailings are likely to be returned if it does not have current mailing \naddresses for its customers. In this situation, the company has wasted money in postage. The primary purpose \nof updating customer contact information is not to achieve sales quotas, determine the customers' buying \nintentions, or establish goodwill through public relations. \n \nSOURCE: NF:002 Maintain customer records \n \nSOURCE: Evans,",

This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. \nEven a simple agreement between two people can constitute a contract made by private law.

In other words, people want more resources than what exists or can be \nproduced easily at any one point in time. Oil, coal, and natural gas are examples of nonrenewable \nresources, meaning that we cannot make more of them.

Although inflation has the potential to occur whenever aggregate market demand \nincreases or aggregate market supply decreases, long-term inflation is ultimately caused by significant, \npersistent increases in the money supply. In other words, there must be a significant increase in the \namount of money available to the economy for prices to increase and inflation to occur. Increases in \nconsumer purchasing power and diminishing returns do not cause inflation. Instead, consumer \npurchasing power decreases as a result of inflation. Diminishing returns are not closely related to \ninflation. \nSOURCE: EC:083 \nSOURCE: FD \nSOURCE: LAP-EC-083—Up, Up, and Away (Inflation) \n \n 9. C \nCompromise. Negotiation is the process of reaching an agreement with another party. In any negotiation, \none party attempts to get another to agree to a certain course of action to meet the party's needs or \nwants. Compromise occurs when an agreement is reached by giving up something in order to obtain \nsomething else. A contract is developed and signed after all parties agree to the terms. A lose-lose \nsituation occurs when neither party gets anything it wants, which usually means that the negotiation has \nbeen suspended. At this stage, a dispute often occurs. \nSOURCE: EI:062 \nSOURCE: FD \nSOURCE: LAP-EI-062—Make It a Win-Win (Negotiation in Business) \n \n\nTest 1238 PERSONAL FINANCIAL LITERACY EXAM—KEY 13 \n \n 10. A \nThe financial needs to start a new business depend on the nature of the venture. The requirements (e.g., \ntime, money) that a person needs to start a business differ and usually depend on the nature of the \nbusiness. For example, a person who starts a home-based consulting business does not require as much \nmoney for the startup as a restaurant franchisee does. The franchisee needs to lease space or build a \nfacility, purchase kitchen equipment, obtain supplies, hire employees, and pay franchise fees, which can \nbe very expensive. A patent is legal protection that provides an owner the sole rights to an invention or \nprocess for a specific time period. Business owners do not always invent goods or processes, so not all \nof them need to obtain patent protection. Equipment is not necessarily the least expensive requirement \nfor a startup business. \nSOURCE: EN:009 \nSOURCE: EI \nSOURCE: U.S. Small Business Administration.

When starting a new business, there is always a risk—the possibility of loss or failure. There are \ndifferent types of risk, such as financial, social, physical, and career. When an entrepreneur leaves a \nsuccessful career with a reputable company to start a business, there is the risk that the entrepreneur \nmay lose her/his ability to go back to the career if the new venture fails. If a venture fails and the \nentrepreneur has not kept up with technological advancements, professional development, or licensing \ncredentials, the entrepreneur may find it difficult to resume her/his career. Because starting a business \ncan be time-consuming and stressful, the entrepreneur may experience social risk (loss of close \nrelationships) or physical risk (health issues related to mental stress), but neither is illustrated in this \nexample. Financial risk is the possibility of losing assets. \nSOURCE: EN:010 \nSOURCE: EI \nSOURCE: Government of Alberta. (2020). How do you handle career risks?

Debit cards are a common method of payment for goods and services. \nIssued by a financial institution (e.g., bank), the debit card is simply inserted into a machine by a \ncardholder or business employee when purchasing a product. Information is transmitted to the \nappropriate location, and the funds are electronically transferred from the cardholder's savings or \nchecking account. An expense account is an arrangement between an employee and his/her employer in \nwhich the employee keeps track of business-related expenses and reports them to his/her employer for \nreimbursement. Interest is the money payments for the use of borrowed money. Credit is the \narrangement by which businesses or individuals can purchase now and pay later. \nSOURCE: FI:058 \nSOURCE: SS \nSOURCE: Federal Trade Commission. (n.d.). Using debit cards.

C \nOverdrawing your account. If you spend more using your debit card than you have in your account, you \nwill overdraw your account, which can lead to fees. It is not possible to overdraw a credit card account. \nCredit and debit cards are both vulnerable to compromised account information. Credit cards carry the \nrisk of interest and fees. Going into debt is a risk associated with credit cards rather than with debit cards. \nSOURCE: FI:058 \nSOURCE: CD \nSOURCE: Weliver, D. (2019, March 27). The 5 biggest debit card dangers.

When a fee or a percentage of a sale is paid to the person providing a service, it is \nconsidered a commission. Wages refer to payments exchanged for hours worked.

It reduces the need to carry cash and provides the convenience of ordering online \nor by phone.

Installment credit is a type of credit account set up to handle one total amount of credit \nwhich is to be paid off in regular installments. The credit user makes a down payment and signs an \nagreement to pay monthly installments, including interest, until the total is paid. Revolving credit limits the \ntotal amount of money that may be owed and charges interest on outstanding balances.

This means that creditors may not discriminate against an individual because of \nhis/her race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or use of public assistance when they \nmake decisions. Individuals are not entitled to a credit guarantee.

D \nRepayment schedule. Individuals and businesses usually borrow money from financial institutions for \nlarge purchases, such as business equipment. A borrower must apply for the loan with the lender and \nprovide the lender with necessary financial status information. The lender reviews this information to \ndetermine if the potential borrower is a good risk and is likely to pay back the loan. If the lender \ndetermines that the borrower meets the necessary criteria, the application is accepted and the loan \nprocess begins. The lender develops a formal document (contract) that the borrower must sign. The \ndocument contains information regarding the loan repayment terms and schedules. The contract does \nnot include a tax code list, a proposal (request) for disbursement, or a guarantee of eminent domain. \nSOURCE: FI:063 \nSOURCE: CD \nSOURCE: Fay, B. (2020).

Economics is the study of how to meet unlimited, competing wants \nwith limited resources. It is the process of deciding how to get the most with the least, or how to obtain \nthe greatest satisfaction with limited resources. An individual's choice of occupation affects his/her \neconomic decisions because it affects income level.

A good way to prioritize your financial goals is to assign each \ngoal to a general category such as \"must do,\" \"important but not critical,\" or \"not so important.\" Ranking \naccording to what needs to be done first and ranking every goal in numerical order are two common \npitfalls.

D \nPlan how much you'll need to set aside each month. Financial planning is necessary to achieving goals \nbecause it allows you to develop a process for getting where you need to be. If you want to save enough \nto buy a phone, you won't just do it overnight—instead, you'll need to plan how much to set aside each \nmonth to get there. Borrowing money from a family member or friend is not necessarily a realistic option. \nOpening a credit card account will not necessarily help you work toward your goal to save money, \nbecause credit cards do not help you save money. Dipping into your emergency fund to buy a phone is \nnot a good idea, because then your emergency fund will be depleted, and it will be difficult to save back \nup again. \nSOURCE: FI:065 \nSOURCE: SS \nSOURCE: Swallow, E.

B \nSave $150 every month to help buy a house in five years. Saving $150 each month to put toward a down \npayment on a house in five years is an example of a realistic long-term goal. Realistic goals are \nachievable with the amount of income an individual has and/or earns. Long-term financial goals are goals \nthat take five or more years to accomplish. Saving money for a $1,000 down payment on a used car is a \nshort-term goal since it can be achieved in less than a year. Earmarking money for utility expenses is an \nexample of budgeting.

Short-term financial goals are goals that will be \ncompleted or met in a matter of days, weeks, or months. Long-term financial goals, on the other hand, \nare goals that span several years—even decades. For a high school student such as Timothy, a relevant \nshort-term goal would be saving money for an upcoming holiday. Saving for college and retirement are \nboth long-term goals.

When you make a personal budget, it's important to divide your expenses into two broad \ncategories.

The first step in setting up your budget is to determine the amount of income you \nhave by adding up salaries, interest, etc. You should not cut any expenses until you have already \ndetermined your income, estimated total expenses, and figured out the difference between them. \nFurthermore, you might not even be able to cut your fixed expenses. Maintaining a spending log is a \ngood way to follow through with your budget once it has been created.

Paying \nin cash can make it more difficult to keep track of purchases because they are not automatically tracked \nby online banking or apps.
